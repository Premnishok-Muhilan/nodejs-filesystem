API Documentation

Overview
This Node.js application uses the Express framework to create an HTTP server that provides endpoints for file operations using the fs module. The application allows clients to create files with a timestamp in their names and to list the names of the files in a specific directory.

Base URL
http://127.0.0.1:3001

Endpoints
1. Get Home
    URL: /

        Content: Hello using experss JS

2. Create File
    URL: /createFile
    Method: GET
    Description: Creates a new text file in the ./TextFiles directory. The filename is generated based on the current timestamp in the format YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.txt. The content of the file is the ISO string representation of the current date and time.

        Status Code: 200 OK
        Content: File created successfully with file name {filename} and file content {timestamp}
            {filename}: The name of the created file, formatted as YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.txt.

3. Get Files
    URL: /getFiles
    Method: GET
    Description: Lists all the filenames in the ./TextFiles directory. The filenames are returned as a newline-separated string wrapped in <pre> tags for preformatted text.
    Response:
        Status Code: 200 OK
        Content: A list of filenames in the ./TextFiles directory, each on a new line.

   Ensure that the TextFiles directory exists before calling the /createFile or /getFiles endpoints to avoid errors.The fs module's synchronous methods (fs.readdirSync) are used in this example.
